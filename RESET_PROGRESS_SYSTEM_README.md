# Reset Progress System

## Overview

The Reset Progress System allows administrators to reset user progress across the platform while preserving basic login credentials. This is useful for:

- Starting fresh with existing users
- Clearing test data
- Resetting users who want to start over
- Maintaining user accounts while clearing all progress

## Features

### üîÑ Reset All Member Progress
- Resets ALL non-admin users simultaneously
- Deletes all career progress, quiz results, project submissions, and achievements
- Resets users to level 1 with 0 XP
- Preserves login credentials (name, email, password, role)

### üë§ Individual User Reset
- Reset progress for specific users
- Same comprehensive reset as bulk operation
- Useful for targeted resets

### üìä Statistics Dashboard
- Real-time statistics on data to be reset
- Shows total users, career progress, quiz results, project submissions, and achievements
- Helps admins understand the scope of reset operations

## Backend Implementation

### Database Operations

The reset system performs the following operations:

1. **Delete Career Progress**: Removes all `UserCareerProgress` records
2. **Delete Quiz Results**: Removes all `QuizResult` records
3. **Delete Project Submissions**: Removes all `ProjectSubmission` records
4. **Delete Achievements**: Removes all `Achievement` records
5. **Reset User Data**: Updates user profile to basic state:
   - `totalXp: 0`
   - `level: 1`
   - `bio: ''`
   - `avatar: ''`
   - `achievements: []`
   - `currentCareer: null`
   - `learningPath: null`
   - `lastActivity: new Date()`

**Preserved Data:**
- `name`
- `email`
- `password` (hashed)
- `role`
- `createdAt`

### Metrics to Track

- Number of reset operations per day
- Success rate of reset operations
- Time taken for bulk resets
- User feedback after resets

## Best Practices

### Before Reset Operations

1. **Backup Data** (if needed)
   ```bash
   npm run backup:user-data
   ```

2. **Notify Users** (if applicable)
   - Inform users about planned reset
   - Provide alternative data export if needed

3. **Test in Development**
   - Always test reset operations in development first
   - Verify data is properly cleared

### After Reset Operations

1. **Verify Reset**
   - Check that all data is cleared
   - Verify users can still login
   - Confirm fresh start experience

2. **Monitor System**
   - Watch for any issues
   - Check user feedback
   - Monitor system performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Reset Not Working**
   - Check admin permissions
   - Verify database connection
   - Check server logs

2. **Partial Reset**
   - Some data remains after reset
   - Check for database constraints
   - Verify all collections are targeted

3. **User Login Issues**
   - Users can't login after reset
   - Check if password was preserved
   - Verify user role wasn't changed

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check admin users
npm run check:admin-users

# Check user progress
npm run check:user-progress

# Validate database state
npm run validate:database
```
