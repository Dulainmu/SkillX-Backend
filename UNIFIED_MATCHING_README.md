# Unified Career Matching System

## Overview

The Unified Career Matching System has been updated to work with your existing **CareerRole database structure** and now includes **advanced skill level matching** with importance weighting. This system provides consistent scoring and ranking across all career roles stored in your MongoDB database.

### ✅ **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Database Integration**: Works directly with your existing `CareerRole` model
2. **Vector-Based Matching**: Uses the 12-dimensional vectors already stored in your database
3. **Personality Enhancement**: Adds personality data to existing career roles
4. **Unified Algorithm**: Single consistent matching algorithm across all endpoints
5. **Updated Weights**: 60% Skills, 40% Personality (Learning style removed)
6. **Advanced Skill Matching**: Level-based skill matching with importance weighting
7. **Enhanced Admin Interface**: Improved CareerPaths admin with skill level management

## Database Structure

Your existing `CareerRole` model structure with new skill fields:

```javascript
{
  name: "Frontend Developer",
  slug: "frontend-developer",
  vector: [3, 4, 4, 2, 4, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 3, 3], // 12-dimensional
  description: "Builds modern web interfaces...",
  
  // NEW: Advanced skill requirements with levels
  requiredSkills: [
    {
      skillId: "javascript",
      skillName: "JavaScript",
      requiredLevel: 4, // 1-5 scale
      importance: "essential" // essential, important, nice-to-have
    },
    {
      skillId: "react",
      skillName: "React",
      requiredLevel: 3,
      importance: "important"
    }
  ],
  
  // Legacy field (backward compatibility)
  skills: ["JavaScript", "React", "CSS", "HTML", "UI Design"],
  
  roadmap: ["Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript", ...],
  detailedRoadmap: [
    {
      id: "fd-1",
      title: "Web Foundations",
      description: "Master the basics of web development.",
      skills: ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"],
      estimatedTime: "2 weeks",
      xpReward: 200,
      projects: [...]
    }
  ],
  averageSalary: "$80,000 - $130,000",
  jobGrowth: "15%",
  
  // Personality data for enhanced matching
  desiredRIASEC: { R: 0.30, I: 0.60, A: 0.70, S: 0.40, E: 0.35, C: 0.40 },
  desiredBigFive: { Openness: 0.70, Conscientiousness: 0.70, Extraversion: 0.50, Agreeableness: 0.60, Neuroticism: 0.30 },
  workValues: ["Achievement", "Independence", "Recognition", "Working Conditions", "Relationships"]
}
```

## Key Features

### ✅ **Consistent Scoring**
- All careers are scored using the same algorithm
- Scores are always between 0-100
- Consistent weights: 60% Skills, 40% Personality

### ✅ **Database Integration**
- Works with existing CareerRole documents
- Preserves all existing data (roadmaps, projects, skills)
- Adds personality data for enhanced matching

### Data Flow

```
User Quiz Answers → Personality Profile → 12D Vector → Database CareerRoles → Ranked Results
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓              ↓              ↓
32 Questions → RIASEC + Big Five + Work Values → Vector Match → CareerRole.vector → Top Matches
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓              ↓              ↓
Skill Levels → Level Comparison → Importance Weighting → CareerRole.requiredSkills → Skill Fit
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```javascript
const { matchCareerRoles, normalizeUserData } = require('./utils/unifiedCareerMatch');

// Load career roles from database
const careerRoles = await CareerRole.find({ isActive: true });

// Create user profile
const profile = scorePersonality(userAnswers, preferences);
const normalizedUser = normalizeUserData({ skills, personalityTraits, preferences });

// Get unified results
const results = matchCareerRoles(careerRoles, normalizedUser, { profile });
```

### API Integration

The system is integrated into the main API endpoints:

- `POST /api/careers/submit-quiz` - Uses unified matching
- `GET /api/recommendations` - Uses unified matching
- `GET /api/recommendations/careers-with-scores` - Uses unified matching

## Migration & Setup

### Running the Migration

```bash
# Full migration (seed + migrate + validate)
npm run migrate

# Just seed career roles if they don't exist
npm run migrate:seed

# Just migrate existing career roles with personality data
npm run migrate:update

# Test the system
npm run test:matching
```

### Migration Process

1. **Check Existing Data**: Verifies if career roles exist in database
2. **Seed if Needed**: Runs `careerRolesSeed.js` if no roles exist
3. **Add Personality Data**: Updates existing roles with personality fields
4. **Validate Migration**: Ensures all data is properly migrated
5. **Test System**: Verifies unified matching works correctly

### Migration Scripts

- `scripts/runMigration.js` - Main migration script with options
- `src/utils/migrateCareerData.js` - Migration utilities
- `src/utils/testUnifiedMatching.js` - Test suite

## Scoring Algorithm

### Weights

```javascript
WEIGHTS: {
    skills: 0.60,        // 60% - Skill requirements match (level-based)
    personality: 0.40,   // 40% - Personality fit (vector similarity)
    learningStyle: 0.00  // 0% - Learning style preference (removed)
}
```

### Skill Matching Algorithm

```javascript
// Level-based skill matching with importance weighting
function computeSkillFit(requiredSkills, userSkills) {
    for (const requiredSkill of requiredSkills) {
        const userSkill = userSkills[requiredSkill.skillName];
        if (userSkill && userSkill.selected && userSkill.level > 0) {
            const userLevel = userSkill.level;
            const requiredLevel = requiredSkill.requiredLevel;
            
            // Calculate fit based on level comparison
            let fit = 0;
            if (userLevel >= requiredLevel) {
                fit = 1.0; // Perfect fit
            } else {
                fit = Math.max(0, userLevel / requiredLevel); // Partial fit
            }
            
            // Apply importance multiplier
            const importanceMultiplier = requiredSkill.importance === 'essential' ? 1.2 : 
                                       requiredSkill.importance === 'important' ? 1.0 : 0.8;
            
            total += fit * importanceMultiplier;
        }
    }
}
```

### Score Calculation

```javascript
// Vector similarity between user and career role
personalityFit = cosineSimilarity(userVector, careerRole.vector)

// Level-based skill fit with importance weighting
skillFit = computeSkillFit(careerRole.requiredSkills, user.skills)

// Weighted score (60% skills, 40% personality)
weightedScore = (skillFit * 0.60) + (personalityFit * 0.40)
finalScore = Math.round(clamp01(weightedScore) * 100)
```

### Example Calculation

```javascript
// Example: User with JavaScript Level 4, React Level 2
// Career requires: JavaScript Level 4 (essential), React Level 3 (important)

// JavaScript: User Level 4 >= Required Level 4 = Perfect Fit (1.0)
// Importance: Essential = 1.2x multiplier
// JavaScript Score: 1.0 * 1.2 = 1.2

// React: User Level 2 < Required Level 3 = Partial Fit (2/3 = 0.67)
// Importance: Important = 1.0x multiplier  
// React Score: 0.67 * 1.0 = 0.67

// Average Skill Fit: (1.2 + 0.67) / 2 = 0.935
// Personality Fit: 0.70 (70% personality match)

// Final Score: (0.935 * 0.60) + (0.70 * 0.40) = 0.561 + 0.28 = 0.841
// Final Score: 84%
```
